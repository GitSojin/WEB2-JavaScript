      technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2024,
      98.9% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the client side for webpage
      behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
      browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on users'
      devices.
